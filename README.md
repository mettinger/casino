# slot machine - ethereum

This repository contains smart contract code for an ethereum slot machine. The frontend code which goes with this contract is located at my other repo: [slotmachine-frontend](https://github.com/mettinger/slotmachine-frontend).  

Both repositories are intended to be easily customizable, making it easy to design and deploy new, creative slot machines on Ethereum.

Backend instructions for creating your custom slot machine:

1.  Put your symbol images, and ONLY your symbol images, in src/assets/symbols.  
2.  And that's it for the frontend!
